# Decisions (append-only)

## D-000 — Operating model (owner, 2026-10-17)
Agent-led engineering. Checkpoints pass on evidence. Escalate to the owner only
for: a significant architecture change; a major compatibility break not listed
here; a performance objective that appears unattainable; a choice between
materially different capabilities; paid infrastructure; any release, push or
deployment. Same-model reviews are not described as independent.

## D-001 — Architecture approved (owner, 2026-10-17)
Register bytecode VM, 16-byte tagged values, COW aggregates, typed handles,
one engine for scripts, shell and templates, per the Runtime 2.0 design report.
The legacy evaluator must be retired; a permanent two-engine state is not
acceptable.

## D-002 — Filesystem freedom (owner, 2026-10-17)
General filesystem operations are not confined to the project directory.
Absolute paths, `..`, symlinks and neighbouring repositories work with normal
OS semantics. Protections for Nift-owned state (metadata, managed outputs,
cleanup) remain. Restrictions for embedders are opt-in host policies and are
not described as a security sandbox. Dependency tracking must cover external
files.

## D-003 — Work location (campaign, 2026-10-17)
The owner's checkout (`/home/nick/Repositories/nift/nift`, inside the
`/home/nick/Repositories/nift` workspace) is reachable only through a file
bridge, later also a sandboxed shell; builds and tests run in a cloud clone of public
`main` (`ce8cd36`). Work is committed on branch `runtime-2` there and delivered
as a git bundle plus patch series. Before each delivery the local checkout's
HEAD is compared with `ce8cd36`; any divergence is recorded in `progress.md`.

## D-004 — Cross-platform evidence (campaign, 2026-10-17)
Only Linux can be executed in the campaign environment. macOS and Windows
verification requires the repository's GitHub workflows, which need a push the
owner has not authorised. Checkpoints therefore record "Linux verified; macOS/
Windows pending CI" until the owner pushes the branch. No checkpoint is called
cross-platform verified without CI results.

## D-005 — Gate on instructions, report wall time (campaign, 2026-10-17)
The campaign host is a shared 2-vCPU VM. Exit gates use callgrind instruction
counts (deterministic); reported results use wall-time medians with the host
fingerprint.
