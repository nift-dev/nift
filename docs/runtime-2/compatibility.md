# Compatibility contract

Must not change unless a decision in `decisions.md` approves it.

| Surface | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| C ABI 1.3 (`include/nift/c_abi.h`) | Symbols and signatures unchanged; additions bump the minor version |
| `nift::Value` / `nift::Engine` C++ API | Source compatible |
| CLI commands and flags | Unchanged; new flags allowed |
| `.nift/` project files and page-info | Readable by new code; new fields optional and versioned; old metadata triggers at most one rebuild |
| Template syntax and output bytes | Byte-identical for unchanged inputs |
| Script syntax and observable results | As `semantics.md`; changes only where a row says **Change** |
| Diagnostics | Message text, codes and spans identical unless a checkpoint records an improvement |
| `nift eval --json` / `--capabilities` | Contract version 1 kept |
| Bindings (Python, Node, Go, C#) | Unchanged; they sit on the C ABI |

## Approved breaks

| Break | Decision | Checkpoint |
